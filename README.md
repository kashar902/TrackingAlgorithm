# Data Tracking Algorithms with DFS (Depth-First Search)

## Overview

✔️ This GitHub repository contains a collection of data tracking algorithms implemented in C# with a primary focus on the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. These algorithms are designed to solve the business logic one of my freelance project, this is the version#01 and sample algorithm.

## Algorithms Included

✔️ **Depth-First Search (DFS):** The DFS algorithm is a versatile graph traversal technique that is widely used for tasks such as pathfinding, connected component analysis, and more. In this repository, we provide a C# implementation of DFS, along with explanations and examples of how to use it for data tracking.
